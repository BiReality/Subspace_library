Scene

You should create an empty GameObject "SceneController" that have Script "BiReality_SDK/Script/SceneController.cs" attached to it. Fill in parameters. 

You are expected to implement InstantiateSceneObjects() and InstantiatePlayerObjects() in SceneController.cs

You are expected to implement InteractUse() in ObjectController.cs


Prefab

Prefabs should be placed in folder "Resources". 

If a GameObject is visible over network, its Prefab should have the following components: 
	PhotonView

If a GameObject is interactable, its Prefab should have the following components: 
	RpcReceiver.cs (a script placeholder whose logic is implemented in terminal)
	CustomInteractUse.cs (a script placeholder whose logic is implemented in terminal)
	RigidBody
	Box Collider
Also, you should implement this function in its controller script: 
	[PunRPC] void InteractUse (int playerId) {}

If a GameObject is grabbable, its Prefab should have the following components: 
	VRTK_FixedJointGrabAttach
	VRTK_SwapControllerGrabAction
